# Introduction
So what do we mean when we talk about responsive web design? It means filling 100% of the browser view in a way that 1. looks good, 2. adjusts in order to respond (see what we did there?) to the needs of different platforms.

So for instance, this site (see image below) looks the same on each platform, but if you look at the difference between the phone, the tablet, and the desktop, the image size and functionality changes based on the size of the view. A+

Some very responsive sites to browse for inspiration are Pack, Smashing Magazine, and Mashable.

You can also find a fantastic list of more responsive websites here.

But what happens if you don't account for those adjustments? All kinds of chaos, is the answer. Buttons may be too small for someone to press on a phone; images may appear too small or too blown out; headers can disappear; whatever you're looking, in general, doesn't look like it quite fits. This is what you'll learn to avoid.

And for an example of a non-responsive site, look no further than Resting Bitch Face.



# Three Ingredients : Sugar , Spice , And Ethan Marcotte
You don't want to get stuck having to build a custom experience for every new device or browser that appears, and at the same time you want to make sure that what you do translates to specific browsers - Internet Explorer included.

There are three key ingredients:
1. Flexible Grid - This means columns that can expand or contract, based on size.
columns
Now, look at the adjustment in the column grid. The righthand and lefthand columns have merged into the center column, so that all the content is still present and legible - but optimized for the different size of the browser.
2. Flexible Images (and media) - These images adjust and extend so that they're 100% visible no matter what the size of the view is.

In both views, the image is fully displayed and fits 100% inside the page view.


3. Media Queries - This is a little bit more difficult if you haven't encountered them before, but media queries determine the break-points at which all your awesome responsive columns and images actually narrow or expand. If you change your browser window size in Pack, you'll be able to find the points at which it narrows to two dogs per line.

# Project 1 : Birthday Card
Welcome to your first project, and aren't you looking younger! In this lesson I'll introduce the birthday page we're going to build, which will utilize HTML5; media queries; flexible images; CSS, and much more.

Pixels - The smallest discrete, controllable point on a display screen. Each pixel helps to make up what you see on your monitor. Whether it's cute dogs or Donald Trump, every image is made up of pixels.

Rems - Flexible units of measurement.

Always think about the ideal experience you want your user to have when they interact with your site. So in the case of Alexis's birthday, I want it to look good on a phone.

Tip: You can emulate different platform views by just making your browser width wider or more narrow.
